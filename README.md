## Winter has come

In this project, We present a search agent that uses different uninformed and informed strategies
to help Jon Snow save Westeros and kill all the white walkers. An optimal plan is one where Jon uses the least number of pieces of dragonglass to kill all the white walkers.

#### Implemented Strategies
1. Breadth-first search.
2. Depth-first search.
3. Iterative deepening search.
4. Uniform-cost search.
5. Greedy search with two heuristics.
6. Aâˆ— search with two *admissible* heuristics.

#### How to run
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `cd src`
3. Compile Main.java `javac Main.java`
4. Run the compiled file `java ./Main`.
